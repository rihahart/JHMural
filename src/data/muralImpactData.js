    description: "For Roosevelt Avenue residents, who've long dealt with the effects of rising illegal activity, this project offers more than murals. It offers hope. While policing addresses the symptoms, art helps address the spirit, creating a sense of belonging and shared purpose that strengthens the neighborhood from within.",

Cities like Philadelphia, Mexico City, and Buenos Aires have seen how public art can help residents reclaim their streets, celebrate local identity, and attract new visitors.
