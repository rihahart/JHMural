  artistStatement: "I am a firm believer that public art can create a more vibrant, social, and beautiful city! This belief guided my partnership with the Jackson Heights Mural Project and the artwork that I've designed. Growing up in Jackson Heights, I've learned to love the strong sense of community felt in this neighborhood. I wanted this mural to cement that feeling, while bringing color and beauty to the surrounding street.",
